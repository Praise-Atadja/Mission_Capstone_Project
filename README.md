## Project Description
This project is an AI-powered system for diagnosing Myocardial Infarction (MI) through Electrocardiogram (ECG) image analysis, with a specific focus on integrating this functionality into existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms, the project aims to provide healthcare professionals with accurate and timely diagnoses of MI based on ECG data. This integration will facilitate seamless access to diagnostic insights within the EHR framework, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently. The initiative seeks to enhance patient care by ensuring that critical diagnostic information is readily available, thereby improving treatment planning and overall outcomes for patients at risk of or experiencing heart attacks.

### Features
Random Forest emerged as the most balanced choice among the three models, delivering consistently high performance with or without hyperparameter tuning. While AdaBoost Classifier showcased flawless accuracy, its computational demands may outweigh its benefits in specific contexts. XGBoost Classifier, although competitive, especially after tuning, requires additional optimization efforts compared to Random Forest, making it slightly less straightforward to implement.
